# CPU
#     nice - determines which process gets more CPU cycles
#         ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority)
#         default is 0
#     sched - don't touch unless you know what you're doing
#
# IO
#     ionice - determines which process gets more IO
#         ranges from 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest priority)
#         default is 4
#     ioclass
#         realtime
#             avoid using
#             highest IO priority, possible to starve other processes
#             can be further adjusted with ionice
#         best-effort
#             this is the default ioclass
#             medium IO priority
#             can be further adjusted with ionice
#         idle
#             lowest IO priority
#             uses IO only if no other process needs IO
#             this ioclass can be given to processes that are known for starving the system
#             CANNOT be further adjusted with ionice

# The `U` in `CPU_U` stands for `untouched`     -> some applications might not like messing with their niceness
# The `H` in `CPU_H` stands for `high priority` -> some applications might require higher priority that the base type
# The `L` in `CPU_L` stands for `low priority`  -> some applications might be less relevant / stress the system when given the priority of the base class
# Same goes for `IO_U`, `IO_H` and `IO_L`
