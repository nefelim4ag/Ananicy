# Cgroups definitions
# Currently very simple, only for group CPU intensive tasks

# cpuquota same as systemd CPUQuota,
# only difference is - meaning of N% is all CPUs, not one core.
{ "cgroup": "cpu90", "CPUQuota": 90 }
{ "cgroup": "cpu80", "CPUQuota": 80 }

# group for high priority processes with fairly low cpu usage.
# This limits their cpu usage to avoid hungups, if they crash
