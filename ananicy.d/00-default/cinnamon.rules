# cinnamon: "the visual part of the cinnamon desktop"
# This includes the internal window manager "muffin"
#
# Within the Cinnamon desktop environment, the Window
# Manager isnâ€™t running in a separate process.
# The main cinnamon process implements the libmuffin 
# library and therefore runs both the visible components
# (panel, applets..etc) and the window manager.

# Among other things, the session manager launches the 
# core components required by the session (such as the 
# desktop itself and its components), as well as 
# applications which are configured to start automatically.
